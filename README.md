Perplexity AI describes itself as a “Swiss Army Knife for information discovery and curiosity.” At its core, it’s an AI-powered search engine that merges the functionalities of a chatbot and a traditional search engine. While it doesn’t completely replace platforms like Google or ChatGPT, it offers a unique approach to information retrieval that is both efficient and user-friendly.

# How Does Perplexity AI Work?
Perplexity leverages various large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 and Claude 3, to enhance its natural language processing capabilities. This allows it to understand user queries and generate relevant summaries effectively.The platform also incorporates a built-in search engine that indexes the web daily. This means you can ask about current events or live scores, and Perplexity will provide up-to-date information.


# Search Types
<b> Perplexity offers two distinct search modes:</b>

<b>Quick Search:</b> Designed for rapid responses to straightforward questions.
Pro Search: Tailored to understand the nuances of your query, Pro Search engages users with follow-up questions to refine responses further.
Regardless of the search type, Perplexity analyzes your question, retrieves relevant sources, and presents a concise summary along with references for deeper exploration.

# What Can You Do with Perplexity AI?
Perplexity is versatile enough to handle a wide range of queries typically suited for traditional search engines. Here are some notable features:

<b>Recipe Suggestions</b>: When asked for a spaghetti bolognese recipe for eight people, Perplexity not only provided a suitable recipe but also adapted it for four people. It lists ingredients in the order they are used, ensuring clarity and usability.
<b>Clarifying Questions</b>: In Pro Search mode, Perplexity asks clarifying questions to deliver more accurate results without requiring you to refine your search terms manually.
<b>Document Uploads:</b> Users can upload documents or images that inform their searches, enhancing the relevance of the results.
<b>Image Generation</b>: The platform can create images related to your queries or generate text based on the content it finds.

# Organizing Information

Perplexity allows users to organize their searches into “Threads,” which can be grouped into collections of related topics. This feature enables you to set specific prompts for each Thread and share them with others, making collaboration easy.

# Addressing AI Hallucinations
While Perplexity strives for accuracy, it is not immune to AI hallucinations — instances where the AI generates plausible-sounding but incorrect information. For example, when asked about personal details or recommendations, it may embellish facts that aren’t directly supported by its sources.This phenomenon highlights the importance of verifying information independently, even when using advanced AI tools like Perplexity.
